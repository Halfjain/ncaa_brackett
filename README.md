# ncaa_brackett

In this project I predicted the brackett for 2019 MCAA Men's Basketball Tournament. 
I calculated advanced stats like offensive and defensive efficiency, strength of scheduale, true shooting percentage, ELO, ect.
The data i had was dating back to 2001 NCAA regular season and the tournament for all the NCAA Division 1 schools, needless to say data cleaning was a challenge.
I built random forests classification and a Logistic Regression model.
